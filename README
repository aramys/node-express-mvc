A simple MVC implementation of Express JS. Models and Controllers are bootstrapped in app.js. Views use the Handlebars Node module, as opposed to Jade. I have provided an example model and controller which can be used to expand upon. There are two routes in the controller, an index page which displays a MongoDB collection of users, and "/new_user" used to post a new user into the collection.
